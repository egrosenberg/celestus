  description: >-
    <p>Action points (represented as green circles) are the primary resource
    needed for using skills in Initiative. Many skills require a certain amount
    of action points to use. While in initiative, a character must spend that
    many action points to use the skill, outside of initiative you can ignore
    these costs.</p><p>Characters have a starting AP and max AP value. At the
    start of each characterâ€™s turns they receive a number of action points equal
    to their starting value. A character can never have more action points than
    their max.</p>
