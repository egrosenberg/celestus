    <p>When playing with 2 or fewer members in a party, each character gains +2
    starting AP, +30% max HP, and +60% max physical and magic
    armor.</p><p>Double all spent combat ability points and attribute points up
    to the normal maximum of 10 and 40 respectively. For example, if a character
    has spent 15 points in strength to a value of 25, they would have that
    increased to 40. Any further points spent would not increase their total
    strength score.</p>
