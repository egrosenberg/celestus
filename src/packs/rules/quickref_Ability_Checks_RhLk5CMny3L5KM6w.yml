    <p>Ability checks test character's talents and skills in an attempt to
    overcome adversity. The GM can ask for an ability check whenever a character
    attempts to accomplish some task that has a chance of
    uncertainty.</p><p>Often the GM will ask for a civil ability check, but in
    rare occasions may ask for a combat ability check. The GM will determine a
    suitable ability and attribute for the check. If they choose a civil ability
    it is a civil ability check, if they choose a combat ability it is a combat
    ability check. If the GM determines there is no suitable bonus, the
    character will only utilize the chosen attribute.</p><p>In order to perform
    an ability check, a character makes a
    @UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.0UljObhEHAo05oGI]{d100 check} and adds a
    bonus that depends on the attribute and ability the GM determined.</p><p>For
    civil ability checks, add 5 times the character's ability total for the
    chosen ability.<br />For combat ability checks, add the character's ability
    total for the chosen ability.<br />For attributes, add the character's
    attribute total minus 10.</p><p>For example, a character makes a Nature
    (Wits) check. The die rolls 56, they have a 3 in Nature, and a 24 in Wits.
    They total would be 56 (die roll) + 3Ã—5 (Nature) + 24-10 (Wits) for a total
    of 85.</p><h3>Difficulty Class</h3><p>When a GM asks for an ability check,
    they will determine a difficulty class (DC), they may choose not to share
    this value. The DC is the number that the check's total needs to surpass in
    order to succeed. Below are some example difficulty classes and how
    difficult they are to
    achieve.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Challenge</h3></td><td><h3>DC</h3></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very
    easy</p></td><td><p>25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Easy</p></td><td><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Average</p></td><td><p>75</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hard</p></td><td><p>100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very
    Hard</p></td><td><p>125</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nigh
    Impossible</p></td><td><p>150</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
