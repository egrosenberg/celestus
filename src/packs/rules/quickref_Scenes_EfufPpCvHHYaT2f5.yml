    <p>A scene is any individual sequence of events. It can take any amount of
    time but shouldn't ever exceed more than a day. Some examples of a scene
    are: trying to escape a collapsing temple, a large uninterrupted stint of
    travel, a combat. Most anything that constitutes rolling initiative would be
    a scene.</p><p>After a scene concludes, characters are able to "refresh"
    some resources, namely their health, armor, and
    @UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.yraIEBlqV1ui6lpV]{Focus Points.}</p>
