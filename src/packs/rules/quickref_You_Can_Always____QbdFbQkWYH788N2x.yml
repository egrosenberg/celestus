    <p class="MsoNormal">Some features (mainly backgrounds and professions) have
    a section titled "You can always..." This is a list of actions your
    character is considered capable of without needing to roll any dice. In
    order to push the limits of these or use them under extraneous circumstances
    your GM may require you to make an ability check.</p><p
    class="MsoNormal">These are invitations, not instructions. If your character
    "can always tell which direction is north," how can they do that? Do they
    have a handy compass they always carry with them? Or maybe they look towards
    the sun and stars for guidance. What if you're underground without your
    tools though? Maybe there's something about on the walls of the ruins that
    allows you to identify which direction they were facing. Get creative with
    it.</p>
