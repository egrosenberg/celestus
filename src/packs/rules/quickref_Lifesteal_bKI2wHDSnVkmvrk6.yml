    <p>Lifesteal is a percentage value that is derived from statuses, features,
    and abilities (namely, the deathbringer
    @UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.iuH7zrOpg909VkOR]{combat ability}). When a
    character deals damage, they also heal an amount equal to the total damage
    dealt multiplied by their lifesteal percentage.</p>
