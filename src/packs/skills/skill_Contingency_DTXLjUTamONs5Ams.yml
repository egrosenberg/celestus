    <p>Choose a Adept Tier or lower non-focus skill that you have memorized that
    can target yourself or only affect yourself (the contingent skill). You
    invoke the skill as part of using this skill but its effects don't occur
    immediately, instead they occur when a specified trigger occurs. You define
    some trigger as you use this skill to active the contingent skill. For
    example, if you might stipulate that a contingent deepsight takes effect
    when you enter a dark room.</p><p>The contingent skill occurs immediately
    after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you will it in
    that moment, and the contingency ends.</p><p>The contingent skill can only
    affect you, even if it normally could target or affect other creatures. You
    can only have one contingency active at a time. If you use this skill again,
    your other contingency ends. Additionally, your contingency ends if this
    skill's material component is ever not on your person.</p>
