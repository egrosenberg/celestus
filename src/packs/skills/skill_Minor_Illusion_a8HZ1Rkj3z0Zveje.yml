  description: >-
    <p>You create a small illusory object or sound at a point you can see within
    range. The illusion can only be auditory or visual, nor both. The illusion
    is intangible and any physical examination reveals its nature. If the
    illusion is visual, it must be contained entirely within a 5-foot cube, you
    can move it, but you cannot animate it.</p><p>The illusion lasts 1 minute or
    until you use this skill again.</p>
