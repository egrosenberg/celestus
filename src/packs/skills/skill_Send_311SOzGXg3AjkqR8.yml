    <p>You send a short message, no more than 25 words, to a creature of your
    choice. If the creature isn't on the same plane of existence as you, there
    is a 5% chance for the skill to fail. The creature hears the message in your
    voice, and understands its meaning as long as it understands a language.</p>
