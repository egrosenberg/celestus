  description: >-
    <p>You become invisible as you create an illusory copy of yourself. The
    illusion lasts for 1 hour, or until you dismiss it, but the invisibility
    only lasts until you use a combat skill or otherwise attempt to interact
    physically with a creature.</p><p>For the duration, you can control the
    illusion, make it gesture, speak in your voice, etc. The illusion is both
    intangible and invulnerable. You can choose to sense through the illusion as
    though you were in its space.</p>
