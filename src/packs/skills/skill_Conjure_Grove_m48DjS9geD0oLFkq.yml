  description: >-
    <p>You perform a 10-minute ritual that transforms an outdoor area into a
    protected grove. The are can be as small as a 20-foot radius sphere, or as
    large as a 50-foot radius sphere. Buildings and other structures are
    excluded from the area. If you use this skill on the same area every day for
    a year its effects become permanent (unless dispelled).</p><p>This skill
    creates the effects included later in this description. When you perform
    this ritual, you may designate any number of creatures as immune to its
    effects. You can also specify a password that one can speak to become immune
    to the effects.</p><p>The entire warded area is magical, but each singular
    effect must be individually dispelled. Once each effect has been dispelled,
    the spell ceases.</p><p><strong>Fog Cloud. </strong>You can fill any number
    of 5-foot squares on the ground are with dense fog that reaches 10 feet
    tall, blinding any creatures within the fog, and blocking any line of sight
    that would pass through it. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog
    appears as a thin mist.</p><p><strong>Entangling Vines. </strong>You can
    fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground (that aren't filled with
    fog) with grasping vines. Any creature who walks over the area is
    @UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.9qo7qdEF3hIuvsXr]{Slowed} and
    @UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.V9M5OZ1zmCrxnpk8]{Rooted}. For a creature
    immune to this, the vines feel reshape themselves to help the creature move,
    rather than harm them, causing no statuses.</p><p><strong>Shift Earth.
    </strong>You can reshape and terraform the plants and ground. Causing plants
    to appear where there were none, and raise or lower the ground in 5-foot
    squares up to 5 feet in either direction.</p>
