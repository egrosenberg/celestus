  description: >-
    <p>You open a gateway to another world. The portal can be a circle or square
    opening between 10 and 20 feet in size. You can cause the portal to appear
    in any orientation and it lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no
    action required).</p><p>The portal has a front face and creatures can only
    travel through its front. If a creature travels through the portal, it
    appears in the nearest unoccupied space.</p><p>Some powerful creatures,
    especially those who hold power over a plane of existence, can prevent a
    gate from being opened near them or within their domain.</p><p>When you use
    this skill, you can instead speak the true name of a creature and cause a
    portal to open beside that creature, so long as it is on a different plane
    of existence, and pull that creature through the portal, placing it beside
    you. A creature transported this way has no special allegiance towards
    you.</p>
