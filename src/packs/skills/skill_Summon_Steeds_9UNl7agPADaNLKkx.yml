  description: >-
    <p>You call forth 4 nature spirits that take the form of a draft animal of
    your choice that appear at points you can see within range. The steeds
    persist for 8 hours, enough for one day of travel, or until their hp is
    reduced to zero. The steeds have 1 hit point and cannot engage in
    combat.</p><p>The steeds allow you to travel roughly 25% faster than you
    would be able to travel by foot.</p>
