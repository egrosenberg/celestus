    <p>You produce an illusion at point you can see within range. The illusion
    can be both auditory and visual, but its visuals must be contained entirely
    within a 20-foot cube and its sound is not loud enough to cause
    damage.</p><p>You can control the image for 1 action point and move it,
    animating it as it moves.</p><p>The illusion does not hold up to physical
    inspection.</p>
