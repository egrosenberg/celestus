    <p>You commune with nature and are able to magically sense the most direct
    physical route to a location you are familiar with. For 24 hours, as long as
    you are on the same plane as your destination, you know its exact distance
    and direction. If you face any crossroads on your journey, you always know
    which one is the most direct.</p>
