    <p>After performing a 1 hour ritual, you take a willing tiny animal to be
    your familiar, which has the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Although its
    intelligence is not increased by this, you can effectively communicate and
    understand your familiar's thoughts.</p></li><li><p>As long as you and your
    familiar are within 1 mile of each other, you can communicate telepathically
    with it and.</p></li><li><p>You can spend 1 action point to shunt it to a
    pocket dimension, and spend 1 action point to summon it from its pocket
    dimension to a point you can see within 30 feet.</p></li><li><p>Your
    familiar shares your level (this doesn't mean it can learn abilities and
    skills like you do).</p></li></ul><p>You can only have one familiar bound at
    a time.</p>
