    <p>You knock on the surface of a locked object and a loud knocking sound can
    be heard up to 300 feet away. If the target is held shut by a nonmagical
    lock, it becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If it has multiple locks,
    this only unlocks one, you choose which one. If the target is locked by an
    @UUID[Compendium.celestus.skills.c3DorrjqY8qWRE6Z]{Arcane Lock}, the effect
    of the lock is suppressed for 10 minutes.</p>
