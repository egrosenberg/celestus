  description: >-
    <p>You perform a 1-minute log ritual that allows you to magically commune
    with a divine entity. You may ask 3 questions, each must be a yes or no and
    you will receive a correct answer.</p><p>Divine beings are not necessarily
    omniscient and you may receive "unclear" as an answer if you ask a question
    the entity is unable to answer. If a one-word answer would be misleading /
    opposed to the entity's interests, the GM may have them answer with a short
    phrase.</p>
