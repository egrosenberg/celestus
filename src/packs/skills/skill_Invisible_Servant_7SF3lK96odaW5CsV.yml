  description: >-
    <p>You summon a magical, invisible, force at a point you can see within
    range. The force can lift and manipulate objects as though it were a
    humanoid and it obeys your verbal commands. The force lasts until you
    dismiss it, it moves more than 30 feet away from you, or you use this skill
    again. </p>
