    <p>You perform a 1-hour ritual that allows you to learn all significant lore
    about a person, place, or object, as described by the GM. The lore might
    include important details, widespread knowledge, or even secrets that have
    never been recorded.</p><p>The more information you know about the target
    before you cast it, the more information you will gain from using this
    skill.</p><p>If the target is not sufficiently legendary, the ritual
    fails.</p>
