    <p>You perform a 10 minute ritual that can allow you to peer in on a
    creature or place.</p><p>If you are attempting to scry on a creature, roll a
    [[/r 1d100]] to determine your success. You need to roll a 50 or higher, but
    the roll can be modified (see attached tables) by your familiarity with the
    target or any physical connection you have. If the skill fails, the target
    is unaware that you tried to spy on them, but they feel a general sense of
    unease wash over them.</p><p></p><h3>Your knowledge of the
    target:</h3><table><tbody><tr><td data-colwidth="366"><p>You have heard of
    the target</p></td><td data-colwidth="147"><p>-20</p></td></tr><tr><td

    connection to the target:</h3><table><tbody><tr><td data-colwidth="366"><p>A

    succeed, you create an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You
    can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor follows
    the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for 1 hour, after which it
    disappears. If something can see the sensor, it appears as a white
    sphere.</p><p>If you targeted a location, the sensor does not move.</p>
