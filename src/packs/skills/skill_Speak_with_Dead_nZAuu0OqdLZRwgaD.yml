  description: >-
    <p>You touch a corpse and imbue it the ability to temporarily speak. The
    corpse must have a mouth.</p><p>For 10 minutes, you are able to ask the
    corpse up to 5 questions. The corpse only has any knowledge it had in life.
    Answers may be cryptic, repetitive, untruthful, or otherwise unhelpful as
    the corpse has no natural compulsion towards truthfulness.</p><p>The corpse
    can't learn new information or comprehend events that have happened since
    its death.</p>
