  description: >-
    <p>You perform a 1 hour ritual that causes a temple to spring into existence
    at a point on the ground you can see within range. The temple must fit into
    unoccupied space within an 150-foot cube. The temple remains for 24
    hours.</p><p>You decide the temple's appearance, including: how/if it is
    lit, the temperature, as well as how many windows it has. The temple is
    enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, and is secured by a single door that
    can only be opened by any creatures you choose to allow as you perform this
    ritual. Creatures cannot teleport into the temple unless you specifically
    allow them to as part of the ritual.</p><p>You can cause the temple to ward
    off particular types of creatures. Choose any from among the following,
    Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. Warded
    creatures cannot enter the temple by any magical or nonmagical
    means.</p><p>Additionally, effects such as the Scrying skill cannot be
    created within the temple and creatures within the temple cannot be targeted
    similar skills.</p><p>The temple is made of solidified magical energy, but
    can appear however you so choose. This magical energy extends into the
    shallows and similar half-dimensions.</p><p>Performing the ritual on the
    same spot every day for a year makes its effects permanent.</p>
