    </strong>is how familiar you are with the place and determines the rate of
    success.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Doesn't Exist: </strong>This location does
    not physically exist or is not on the same plane of existence as
    you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heard of: </strong>You have either heard of this
    place or otherwise know of its
    existence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seen:</strong> You have seen this place,
    either physically or by magical means such as
    scrying.</p></li><li><p><strong>Visited: </strong>You have personally been
    to this place before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Familiar: </strong>You have
    been to this place many times and are intimately familiar with
    it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can See:</strong> You can currently physically
    see the location you are attempting to teleport
    to.</p></li><li><p><strong>Object:</strong> You have an object that has been
    taken from the location some time in the past 6
    months.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Mishap:</strong> Some sort of magical
    disaster takes place as you attempt to teleport causing the spell to fail.
    Each target (including yourself) gains 2 levels of
    exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Similar Location: </strong>You teleport to some
    location that matches a similar description but is not your actual
    destination.</p><p><strong>Off Target: </strong>You teleport to a location
    that is near your target but some distance away. The location you teleport
    to is determined by the GM rolling two d10 and multiplying the results. That
    number is the percentage of the total distance meant to be traveled the
    target is off target by. For example, if you were teleporting 50 miles, and
    the GM rolled a 4 and 6, you would arrive 24%, or 12 miles off target. The
    direction should be determined randomly by the GM.</p><p><strong>Success:
    </strong>You arrive at your destination unharmed.</p>
