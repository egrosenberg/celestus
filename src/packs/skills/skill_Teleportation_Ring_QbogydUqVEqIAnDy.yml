  description: >-
    <p>You spend 10 minutes drawing a 5-foot radius circle onto the ground with
    chalks. At the end, it sparks with magic, opening a temporary gateway to a
    permanent teleportation ring who's sigils you know. The gateway remains open
    for 10 seconds.</p><p>Any creature that enters the gateway is instantly
    transported to the linked ring, and appears in the nearest unoccupied
    space.</p><p>Many notable locations have teleportation rings. When you learn
    this skill, you gain knowledge of 2 locations that you and the GM decide
    make sense for you to know of.</p>
