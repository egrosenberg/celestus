    <p>You open a 2-foot wide, 5-foot tall, portal that links between target
    plant you touch, and another plant you have seen. Both plants must be of
    adequate size to accommodate the portal. The portal persists for 1 minute,
    before disappearing. Any creature partially inside the portal as it
    disappears remains on the side they started in.</p>
