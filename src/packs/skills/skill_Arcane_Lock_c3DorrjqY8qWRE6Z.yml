  description: >-
    <p>You touch a closed door or container and magically lock it. Unless this
    is dispelled, the lock can't become unlocked. You and any creatures you
    choose as you use this skill can still open the object despite the lock. You
    can also set a verbal or somatic password, that when spoken or gestured
    unlocks the object for 1 minute.</p>
