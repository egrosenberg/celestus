    <p>You cause a magical door to appear at a point you can see within range
    that lasts for 24 hours. The door leads to a pocket-dimension that houses a
    dwelling brought up by your imagination. The door can be up to 10 feet in
    height and width. When you use this skill you can choose any number of
    creatures to be allowed to freely enter through the door. While you are
    within 30 feet of the door you can cause it to open or close without using
    an action. While the door is closed, it can't be perceived by any
    means.</p><p>Beyond the door lies a dwelling that matches whatever you
    fancy. The dwelling's atmosphere can be any that you choose, but it isn't
    cold enough or hot enough to cause any damage or otherwise adverse
    effects.</p><p>You can create any floor plan you choose but it's volume
    can't exceed 100,000 cubic feet. The mansion is decorated and furnished
    however you choose and contains enough food to luxuriously serve 100 people.
    Objects created by this skill exploded into a harmless cloud of mist if they
    are removed from the dwelling.</p><p>The mansion is staffed by 100 spectral
    servants who attend to any who enters the mansion. You determine the
    appearance of the servants and any attire they have. The servants are immune
    to all damage and statuses. The servants can perform any tasks a standard
    humanoid would be able to perform, but they cannot harm another
    creature.</p><p>When the skill ends you can choose to either have any
    objects left inside be left inside the mansion, waiting until the skill is
    used again, or expelled safely to an unoccupied space nearest to the door's
    previous location.</p>
