  description: >-
    <p>Touching a wet blood, you reveal information of its source. The blood
    reforms on the surface into a unique pattern to the creature it belonged to.
    This pattern is not enough for you to tell who it belonged to on its own,
    but comparing multiple patterns allows you to confirm they belonged to the
    same creature. The pattern also provides enough information to garner the
    kind of creature the blood belonged to.</p>
