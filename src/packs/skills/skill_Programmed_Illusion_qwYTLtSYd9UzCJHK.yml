  description: >-
    <p>You create an illusion of some visual and/or auditory phenomenon that
    comes into effect when a specified condition occurs. The condition must be
    some auditory or visual condition that is objective. For example, "when an
    ally enters within 5 feet" wouldn't work, but "when a creature wearing royal
    regalia enters" would.</p><p>The illusion itself can fill up to a 30-foot
    cube and last up to 5 minutes. You choose the appearance of the illusion and
    can cause it to animate in any way you choose as you use this skill. After
    the illusion's duration has elapsed it disappears and remains dormant for 5
    minutes, after which it can be activated again.</p><p>The illusion itself
    doesn't hold up to physical investigation as any creature or object that
    would touch it instead passes through.</p>
